# Pera Swarm Active Localization and Navigation
___

## Overview

Localization and mapping are crucial for swarm robotic systems to achieve coordinated autonomy in dynamic environments. Unlike single-robot SLAM, swarm robotics requires decentralized or cooperative approaches to efficiently share positional and environmental data among multiple agents. Techniques such as multi-agent SLAM, topological mapping, and probabilistic localization enable robust navigation while minimizing computational and communication overhead. Sensor fusion, incorporating LiDAR, IMU, and vision-based methods, enhances accuracy in GPS-denied environments.Focus to implement localization and mapping without using GPS for swarm system which includes UGC's and UAU's.Advanced strategies like collaborative loop closure, distributed pose graph optimization, and reinforcement learning improve adaptability and resilience in uncertain conditions. The integration of machine learning and neural networks further refines localization accuracy, making swarm robotic systems more efficient for applications in search-and-rescue, exploration, and industrial automation.
